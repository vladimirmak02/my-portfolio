## Recreating a spaceship from no man's sky.

This was a project that I did for a course on computer graphics.
The final exercise was to create an original blender model and render it.
In the course, we built a 3d renderer in C++, so a bonus was rendering our model with the renderer we built.

While most people created variations on the donut tutorial, I decided to recreate a spaceship from a game i was playing at the time, No Man's Sky. I just fund a rare and beautiful starship that I wanted to show off by making a replica of it.

**Here are the reference screenshots I took in-game:**

It took me a while to figure out the sculpting of the spaceship, since it has a pretty unique and complex shape, unlike most spaceships in the game which are blocky and full of angles and straight lines (which makes sense since space has no air drag).

**This is my first draft render after a couple days of work:**

I decided to add asteroids, light streaks and a space station like in the reference photos, to create **the final product:**

I'm very happy and proud of my creation, i think it does at least a little justice to the beauty and wonder of the game and the spaceships and planets in it. My only regret is that I had no time to put a planet in the scene as well, as that would be a nice addition.

Took inspiration from this spaceship tutorial:

Used this tutorial to create rocks (asteroids):

Used this texture thingy (node) for the triangles on stuff:

There were other tutorials that I followed and adapted for small parts of this project,
but I didn't copy their content and only used the techniques shown in them,
and there are probably too many to reference them all here.

No other external help (that I can think of) was used in this project.
