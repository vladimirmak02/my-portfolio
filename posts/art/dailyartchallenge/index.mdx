## Inspired by contrasting longevity and impermanence

Most of the 'art' in this collection is unconventional and really impermanent in reality. Capturing it on camera and uploading it to the internet, however, preserves it far beyond any time that it ought to exist for. For each of the artpieces, an estimated real-word longevity is given to emphasise that contrast.

## Daily Challenge Format

The process of creating these works was spontaneous and took place over 1 week in August where every day I would challenge myself to create something I considered art and save it using my phone's camera.
