## Map made to show good Roller Skating spots and paths in Paris!

While in Paris, I found a deficiency of resources to find good roller skating paths and cool spots to skate and have fun.

There are plenty of resources for bikes, but bigger wheels give bikes an advantage on many surfaces. 
Cobblestones might be uncomfortable on bikes, but on rollerskates they are impossible to traverse.

So I used the my maps feature in google maps to create an interactive map of some spots that I researched and tested. 
I will try to update it as I skate more.

So far, I have the following locations:
1. Along the River Seine - north bank, in the centre of town.
2. Along the River Seine - south bank, in the centre of town.

Here is a link to the map:

Or a live version on this web page:
<div
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: '56.25%',
    height: 0,
    overflow: 'hidden',
    maxWidth: '100%',
  }}

    width="640"
    height="480"
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
      border: 0,
    }}
    allowFullScreen=""
    loading="lazy"
  ></iframe>
</div>

Feel free to use it however you like!
